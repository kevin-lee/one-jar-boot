## Fixed
* URLs to the resources inside jar files should not have `//` (double slash) (#1)
  
  URLs to the resources inside jar files should not have `//` (double slash).
  When One-JAR forms the URL for the resources inside a jar file, It seems
  * it prepends `/` to the filename or
  * the filename already has it but it doesn't trim it properly.
  
  Either way, a quick fix might be replacing all `!//` with `!/` in a resource URL when [OneJarURLConnection](/Kevin-Lee/one-jar-boot/blob/90ad7f7f4979dfd7074fa5e7ceffbff6a8684099/src/main/java/com/simontuffs/onejar/OneJarURLConnection.java#L28) is created with the resource URL.
* Should be artifactId "workspace" instead of one-jar-boot (#3)
